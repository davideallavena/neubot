Description: Network neutrality bot
 Neubot is a research project on network neutrality of the NEXA
 Center for Internet & Society at Politecnico di Torino. The project
 is based on a lightweight open-source program that interested users
 can download and install on their computers. The program runs in
 background and periodically performs transmission tests with some
 test servers and with other instances of the program itself. These
 transmission tests probe the Internet using various application
 level protocols. The program saves tests results locally and uploads
 them on the project servers. The collected dataset contains samples
 from various Providers and allows the Neubot project to monitor
 network neutrality.
